# The Full-stack JavaScript Course

> Make sure to read this introduction carefully to understand the requirements to finish the course successfully.

In this course you will learn how to build and deploy web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The course is divided into 31 chapters (super-skills). Each super-skill introduces new subjects on which you will be tested by doing:

1. **Checkpoint (assignment)**:
    * You should submit the checkpoint by the end of each super-skill.
    * The assignment should be submitted on GoMyCode platform at time (late submission might be rejected).
    * A submitted checkpoint will be assessed with a feedback by your instructor.
2. **One-to-one interview (oral test)**:
    * It is a Job interview simulation between the student and the instructor.
    * During the interview you will not be corrected or receive any feedback from the instructor.
    * You should use the platform to book the interview.

Each class session will involve a live-coding session conducted by the instructor to help you better understand the concepts introduced by the super-skills. During the live-coding session, you are very encouraged to ask questions and start discussions. Therefore, you should be well prepared by reading the super-skill topics before coming to the class.

## Session Timeline

1. **Standup meeting**: the student discuss with the instructor what he/she had done since the last session and what is he/she planning to do during the current session.
2. **Working on the tasks**: the student is given a time to work on his/her tasks (the ones which agreed to work on during the standup meeting).
3. **Live-coding session**: the instructor dedicate a time for a live-coding session that help the students better understand the super-skill topics.
4. **Assessment**: the instructor assesses student achievements and self-learning progress during the current class session.
